=== SUMMARY: INTEGRATED CONCORDANCE INDEX (Event 1) ===
Test set size: 54 patients
Time range: 0.1 131.8 months
Event distribution:
  Censored (0): 11 ( 20.4 %)
  Relapse (1): 21 ( 38.9 %)
  TRM (2): 22 ( 40.7 %)

Integrated Concordance Index Results (higher is better):
  RF        : 0.526
  Ensemble  : 0.526
