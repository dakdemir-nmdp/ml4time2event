\usage{
PredictAllPossibleOutcomesSurvOrCifs(data, modelslist, modeltypes, times)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame for which to generate predictions.}

\item{modelslist}{A list where each element is a fitted model object (e.g., output from `RunSurvModels` or `RunCRModels`).}

\item{modeltypes}{A character vector of the same length as `modelslist`, indicating the type of each model ("SURV" or "CR").}

\item{times}{Numeric vector of time points at which to generate predictions.}
}
\value{
A list of the same length as `modelslist`, where each element contains the prediction output
  (typically including interpolated probabilities/CIFs) from the corresponding `PredictSurvModels` or `PredictCRModels` function.
  Returns NA for unsupported model types.
}
\description{
Get predictions (Survival Probs or CIFs) for a given dataset from a list of fitted models.
Handles both survival ('SURV') and competing risks ('CR') models based on `modeltypes`.
}
