\usage{
PredictSurvModels(
  models,
  newdata,
  new_times,
  models_to_use = NULL,
  ensemble_method = "average",
  model_weights = NULL,
  super_learner_training_data = NULL,
  super_learner_timevar = NULL,
  super_learner_eventvar = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{List containing the fitted models (output from 'RunSurvModels').}

\item{newdata}{Data frame with new data for prediction.}

\item{new_times}{Numeric vector of times for which predictions are required.}

\item{models_to_use}{Character vector of model names to use for ensemble prediction.
If NULL (default), uses all successfully fitted models. Model names should match
those in the models list (e.g., "RF_Model", "glmnet_Model", "CPH_Model").}

\item{ensemble_method}{Character specifying ensemble method: "average" (default),
"weighted", or "super_learner".}

\item{model_weights}{Named numeric vector of weights for weighted ensemble method.
Must sum to 1 (or will be normalized). Only used when ensemble_method="weighted" or
when ensemble_method="super_learner" with pre-computed weights.}

\item{super_learner_training_data}{Data frame with training data for super learner
weight optimization. Only required when ensemble_method="super_learner", model_weights=NULL,
and weights are not pre-computed using ComputeSuperLearnerWeights().}

\item{super_learner_timevar}{Name of time variable in super_learner_training_data.}

\item{super_learner_eventvar}{Name of event variable in super_learner_training_data.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - ModelPredictions: A list of individual model predictions (interpolated probability matrices).
  - NewProbs: Ensembled prediction matrix (averaged on cumulative hazard scale).
  - models_used: Character vector of model names actually used in the ensemble.
  - ensemble_method: The ensemble method used.
}
\description{
Utility function to get predictions from several survival models
at the same time and calculate an ensemble prediction.
