\title{Predict_CRModel_FineGray}
\usage{
Predict_CRModel_FineGray(
  modelout,
  newdata,
  new_times = NULL,
  event_of_interest = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelout}{the output from 'CRModel_FineGray'}

\item{newdata}{data frame with new observations for prediction}

\item{new_times}{optional numeric vector of time points for prediction.
If NULL (default), generates 50 equally-spaced points from 0 to max observed time.
Can be any positive values - interpolation handles all time points.}

\item{event_of_interest}{character or numeric scalar indicating the event code
for which CIFs should be returned. If NULL (default), uses the event code
stored in the fitted model. Fine-Gray models can only predict the event they
were trained on.}
}
\value{
a list containing:
  \item{CIFs}{predicted cumulative incidence function matrix
    (rows=times, cols=observations)}
  \item{Times}{the times at which CIFs are calculated
    (always includes time 0)}
}
\description{
Get predictions from a fitted Fine-Gray competing risks model for new data.

# Fit model
model <- CRModel_FineGray(data, expvars = c("x1", "x2"),
                         timevar = "time", eventvar = "event")

# Predict on test data
preds <- Predict_CRModel_FineGray(model, test_data)

# Predict at specific times
preds_custom <- Predict_CRModel_FineGray(model, test_data,
                                        new_times = c(30, 60, 90, 180, 365))
