\usage{
PredictCRModels(
  models,
  newdata,
  newtimes,
  models_to_use = NULL,
  ensemble_method = "average",
  model_weights = NULL,
  super_learner_training_data = NULL,
  super_learner_timevar = NULL,
  super_learner_eventvar = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{the output from 'RunCRModels'}

\item{newdata}{the data for which the predictions are to be calculated}

\item{newtimes}{the times for which the predictions obtained}

\item{models_to_use}{Character vector of model names to use for ensemble prediction.
If NULL (default), uses all successfully fitted models. Model names should match
those in the models list (e.g., "RF_Model", "FG_Model", "Cox_Model").}

\item{ensemble_method}{Character specifying ensemble method: "average" (default),
"weighted", or "super_learner".}

\item{model_weights}{Named numeric vector of weights for weighted ensemble method.
Must sum to 1 (or will be normalized). Only used when ensemble_method="weighted" or
when ensemble_method="super_learner" with pre-computed weights.}

\item{super_learner_training_data}{Data frame with training data for super learner
weight optimization. Required when ensemble_method="super_learner" and model_weights=NULL
and weights are not pre-computed.}

\item{super_learner_timevar}{Name of time variable in super_learner_training_data.}

\item{super_learner_eventvar}{Name of event variable in super_learner_training_data.}
}
\value{
a list containing the following objects.
ModelPredictions: a list of individual model predictions,
NewProbs: ensembled predictions for CIFs,
models_used: Character vector of model names actually used in the ensemble,
ensemble_method: The ensemble method used.
}
\description{
Utility function to get predictions from  several competing risks models
at the same time. Also adds an ensemble prediction for the probabilities.
