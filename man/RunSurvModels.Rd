\arguments{
\item{datatrain}{data frame with training data (explanatory and outcome variables)}

\item{ExpVars}{character vector of names of all explanatory variables in data}

\item{timevar}{character name of time variable in data}

\item{eventvar}{character name of event variable in data (needs to be 0/1)}

\item{models}{character vector of additional models to fit, chosen from:
"glmnet" (penalized Cox with elastic net), "coxph" (Cox with backward selection),
"rulefit", "xgboost", "gam", "gbm", "ExpSurvReg", "WeibSurvReg", "bart".}

\item{ntreeRF}{number of trees for Random Forest models.}

\item{nvars}{number of top variables (based on RF importance) to use for the second RF model and potentially others.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to individual model fitting functions (currently not explicitly handled, consider adding specific args).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - input: list with ExpVars, ExpVars2 (top N vars), timevar, eventvar.
  - RF_Model: Output from SurvModel_RF using all ExpVars.
  - RF_Model2: Output from SurvModel_RF using top ExpVars2.
  - ... other fitted model outputs named according to the 'models' input (e.g., glmnet_Model, CPH_Model).
}
\description{
Utility function to run several survival models at the same time.
Fits two Random Forest models (one with all vars, one with top N vars) automatically.
