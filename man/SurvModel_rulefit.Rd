\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with explanatory and outcome variables.}

\item{expvars}{Character vector of names of explanatory variables in `data`.}

\item{timevar}{Character name of the time-to-event variable in `data`.}

\item{eventvar}{Character name of the event indicator variable in `data`.}

\item{ntree}{Integer, the number of trees to generate for rule extraction.}

\item{nsample}{Integer, the number of samples to draw (with replacement) for training each tree.}

\item{keepvars}{Character vector of variable names to be included in every tree's bagging iteration.}

\item{cuttimes}{Numeric vector of time points used to create binary outcomes for classification trees.
If NULL, quantiles of the time variable are used.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric, the elastic net mixing parameter (default: 0.5).}

\item{maxit}{Integer, maximum number of iterations for glmnet (default: 2000).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to glmnet::cv.glmnet.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{model}{The fitted RuleFit model object containing all components.}
\item{times}{Unique event times observed in the training data.}
\item{varprof}{A profile of the explanatory variables.}
\item{expvars}{The names of the original explanatory variables.}
\item{factor_levels}{A list containing factor levels for each variable to ensure consistent prediction.}
}
\description{
Implements the RuleFit algorithm by generating rules from an ensemble of
decision trees and fitting a penalized Cox model (via glmnet) on the original
features plus the derived rules.
