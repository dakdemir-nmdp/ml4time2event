\description{
A cleaned and imputed version of the NCCTG lung cancer study used in the
survival-analysis vignette. The dataset has missing values imputed with
`missRanger`, categorical variables encoded as factors, and includes a few
engineered predictors that illustrate feature creation.
}
\details{
Derived from the NCCTG lung cancer dataset included with the package.
  Missing values were imputed using `ImputeMissinRecordsData()` and engineered
  features were added for demonstration purposes.
