\usage{
Predict_CRModel_DeepSurv(
  modelout,
  newdata,
  newtimes = NULL,
  event_of_interest = NULL,
  other_models = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelout}{the output from 'CRModel_DeepSurv'}

\item{newdata}{data frame with new observations for prediction}

\item{newtimes}{optional numeric vector of time points for prediction.
If NULL (default), uses the baseline hazard times from training.}

\item{event_of_interest}{character or numeric scalar indicating the event code
for which CIFs should be returned. If NULL (default), uses the event code
stored in the fitted model. DeepSurv models can only predict the event they
were trained on.}

\item{other_models}{optional named list of additional fitted
`CRModel_DeepSurv` objects (one per competing event). When provided,
the function combines all
cause-specific hazard models using the Aalen-Johansen estimator to obtain
cumulative incidence functions. If omitted, only the cause-specific hazard
and cumulative hazard for the event of interest are returned.}
}
\value{
a list containing:
  \\item{CIFs}{predicted cumulative incidence function matrix
    (rows=times, cols=observations). Available only when `other_models`
    are supplied; otherwise `NULL`.}
  \\item{Times}{the times at which predictions are calculated}
  \item{CauseSpecificHazard}{matrix of cause-specific hazard increments
    for the event of interest (rows = intervals, cols = observations)}
  \item{CauseSpecificCumHaz}{matrix of cumulative cause-specific hazards
    at each time point}
  \item{CauseSpecificSurvival}{matrix of survival probabilities derived
    from the cause-specific hazard alone}
  \item{TotalSurvival}{matrix of overall survival probabilities that
    incorporate all supplied cause-specific hazards}
}
