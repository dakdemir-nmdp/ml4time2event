## Event Indicator Standardization

All datasets follow standardized coding conventions:

### Standard Survival (Single Event)
```
0 = Censored (event did not occur)
1 = Event occurred
```

### Competing Risks (Multiple Events)
```
0 = Censored (no event occurred)
1 = Event of interest (e.g., relapse, melanoma death)
2 = Competing risk event (e.g., TRM, other death)
3+ = Additional competing risks (if applicable)
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Standard Survival Analysis

```r
# Load a standard survival dataset
lung <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "lung_dataset.csv",
                             package = "ml4time2event"))

# Create survival object
library(survival)
surv_obj <- Surv(time = lung$time, event = lung$status)

# Kaplan-Meier curve
km_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ 1, data = lung)
plot(km_fit)

# Cox proportional hazards model
cox_fit <- coxph(surv_obj ~ age + sex + ph.ecog, data = lung)
summary(cox_fit)
```

### Competing Risks Analysis

```r
# Load a competing risks dataset
bmtcrr <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "bmtcrr_competing_risks.csv",
                               package = "ml4time2event"))

# Cumulative incidence function
library(cmprsk)
cif <- cuminc(ftime = bmtcrr$ftime,
              fstatus = bmtcrr$Status,
              group = bmtcrr$Phase)
plot(cif)

# Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model
fg_fit <- crr(ftime = bmtcrr$ftime,
              fstatus = bmtcrr$Status,
              cov1 = model.matrix(~ Sex + Age + Phase, data = bmtcrr)[,-1],
              failcode = 1)
summary(fg_fit)
```
