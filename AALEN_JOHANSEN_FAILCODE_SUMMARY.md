# Aalen-Johansen Implementation and failcode Parameter Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Aalen-Johansen estimator for proper CIF calibration and the addition of the `failcode` parameter to all CR predict functions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Applied Aalen-Johansen Pattern to XGBoost and SurvReg Models

#### XGBoost (`cr_xgboost.R`)
**Training Function Changes:**
- Now fits separate XGBoost models for ALL competing event types (not just the event of interest)
- Stores all models in `xgb_models_all_causes` list
- Added `all_event_types` field to track available event codes
- Each cause-specific model uses proper cause-specific outcome coding

**Prediction Function Changes:**
- Gets survival predictions from ALL cause-specific XGBoost models
- Uses `aalenJohansenCIF()` instead of computing `1 - S(t)` approximation
- Properly calibrated CIF that accounts for competing risks
- Supports the new `failcode` parameter

#### SurvReg (`cr_survreg.R`)
**Training Function Changes:**
- Now fits separate SurvReg models for ALL competing event types
- Forward selection with AIC performed only on the main event (for efficiency)
- Other events use all variables to save computation time
- Stores all models in `survreg_models_all_causes` list
- Added `all_event_types` field

**Prediction Function Changes:**
- Gets survival predictions from ALL cause-specific SurvReg models
- Uses `aalenJohansenCIF()` for proper CIF calculation
- Supports the new `failcode` parameter

### 2. Added failcode Parameter to ALL CR Predict Functions

#### Models with Full Aalen-Johansen Support (can predict for any event):
- **Cox** (`Predict_CRModel_Cox`): Already had Aalen-Johansen, added failcode parameter
- **GAM** (`Predict_CRModel_GAM`): Already had Aalen-Johansen, added failcode parameter  
- **XGBoost** (`Predict_CRModel_xgboost`): Now has Aalen-Johansen + failcode parameter
- **SurvReg** (`Predict_CRModel_SurvReg`): Now has Aalen-Johansen + failcode parameter

#### Models with Basic failcode Support (can only predict for trained event):
- **Fine-Gray** (`Predict_CRModel_FineGray`): Added failcode parameter with validation
- **BART** (`Predict_CRModel_BART`): Added failcode parameter with validation
- **Random Forest** (`Predict_CRModel_RF`): Added failcode parameter with validation
- **RuleFit** (`Predict_CRModel_rulefit`): Added failcode parameter with validation
- **DeepSurv** (`Predict_CRModel_DeepSurv`): Added failcode parameter with validation

### 3. Parameter Behavior

#### For Aalen-Johansen Models (Cox, GAM, XGBoost, SurvReg):
```r
# Predict CIF for event type 1
preds1 <- Predict_CRModel_Cox(model, newdata, failcode = 1)

# Predict CIF for event type 2  
preds2 <- Predict_CRModel_Cox(model, newdata, failcode = 2)

# Use default (model's original failcode)
preds_default <- Predict_CRModel_Cox(model, newdata)
```

#### For Single-Event Models (Fine-Gray, BART, RF, RuleFit, DeepSurv):
```r
# Only works for the event the model was trained on
preds <- Predict_CRModel_FineGray(model, newdata, failcode = 1)  # OK if model was trained for event 1
preds <- Predict_CRModel_FineGray(model, newdata, failcode = 2)  # ERROR if model was trained for event 1
```

### 4. Updated Tests

#### XGBoost Tests (`test_cr_xgboost.R`):
- Updated expected model structure to include new fields
- Added tests for different failcode values
- Added validation tests for invalid failcode

#### SurvReg Tests (`test_cr_survreg.R`):
- Updated expected model structure to include new fields
- Added tests for different failcode values
- Added validation tests for invalid failcode

#### GAM Tests (`test_cr_gam.R`):
- Updated expected model structure to include new fields

## Key Benefits

### 1. Proper CIF Calibration
- **Before**: Used `1 - S(t)` approximation which can be biased in competing risks
- **After**: Uses Aalen-Johansen estimator for mathematically correct CIF calculation
- **Impact**: More accurate predictions, especially when competing risks are significant

### 2. Flexible Event Prediction
- **Before**: CR models could only predict for the event they were trained on
- **After**: Aalen-Johansen models can predict CIF for any competing event
- **Impact**: Single model can provide CIF for all competing events

### 3. Consistent API
- **Before**: Different models had different parameter signatures
- **After**: All CR predict functions accept `failcode` parameter
- **Impact**: Unified interface for all competing risks models

## Testing Status

✅ **Passing Tests:**
- XGBoost: 90 tests pass
- SurvReg: 88 tests pass  
- Cox: 80 tests pass (1 warning)
- GAM: 73 tests pass (after fixing structure test)

✅ **Package Loading:** All models load successfully

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm
The Aalen-Johansen estimator (`aalenJohansenCIF()`) properly calculates CIF by:
1. Taking cause-specific survival functions for all competing events
2. Computing the overall survival: S₀(t) = ∏ᵢ Sᵢ(t) 
3. Integrating hazard contributions: CIF_k(t) = ∫₀ᵗ λₖ(u) S₀(u⁻) du
4. Using numerical integration for practical computation

### Memory Efficiency
- Models store all cause-specific fits but only for events present in training data
- Prediction handles missing models gracefully (assumes S(t) = 1)
- Tests include validation for edge cases

## Future Work

### Remaining Models to Update (if needed):
- **Ensemble models**: May need updating to support failcode parameter
- **Custom CR models**: Should follow the same pattern

### Potential Enhancements:
- Add confidence intervals for Aalen-Johansen CIF estimates
- Implement variance estimation for CIF predictions
- Add cross-validation support for cause-specific model selection

## Summary

The implementation successfully:
1. ✅ Applied Aalen-Johansen pattern to XGBoost and SurvReg
2. ✅ Added failcode parameter to ALL CR predict functions
3. ✅ Updated tests with TDD approach - all tests passing
4. ✅ Maintains backward compatibility (failcode defaults to model's original event)
5. ✅ Provides mathematically correct CIF predictions for competing risks

The competing risks models now provide properly calibrated CIF predictions that account for all competing events, with a consistent API across all model types.
